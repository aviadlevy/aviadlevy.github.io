In this guide, we will walk you through the steps required to install the go-yara library on a Windows machine using MSYS2 and MinGW.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your Windows machine:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>MSYS2: You can download the MSYS2 installer from the official website and follow the installation instructions provided there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go: Make sure you have Go (Golang) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Go from the official website.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Installation Steps</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Install required packages</h3>\n<p>Open the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal and run the following command to install the necessary packages:</p>\n<pre><code>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config base-devel openssl-devel autoconf-wrapper automake libtool\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Step 2: Download YARA source code</h3>\n<p>Download the YARA source code from the official GitHub repository at: <a href=\"https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases\">https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases</a></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Build and Install YARA</h3>\n<p>Navigate to the YARA source code directory using the MSYS2 terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>cd /path/to/yara-source-code\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, run the following commands to build and install YARA:</p>\n<pre><code>./bootstrap.sh\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Step 4: Add MinGW to Path</h3>\n<p>To ensure that everything works smoothly, you need to add the MinGW binaries directory to your system’s Path. By default, MinGW is installed at C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin. Add this path to your system's environment variables.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Run your application</h3>\n<p>Now you can run your application from any command line or IDE directly (you don’t need to use MinGW anymore).</p>\n<p>To make the go-yara library work correctly, you need to set the CGO_ENABLED and GOARCH environment variables. Open your system's Environment Variables settings and add the following entries:</p>\n<pre><code>export CGO_ENABLED=1\nexport GOARCH=amd64\n</code></pre>\n<p>When running your application you should use following command:</p>\n<pre><code>go build -ldflags \"-extldflags=-static\" -tags yara_static main.go\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Test the Installation</h2>\n<p>To verify that go-yara is correctly installed on your system, you can create a simple Go program that uses the library to run a YARA rule. Here’s a basic example:</p>\n<pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n\n \"github.com/hillu/go-yara/v4\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n c, err := yara.NewCompiler()\n if c == nil || err != nil {\n  fmt.Println(\"Error to create compiler:\", err)\n  return\n }\n rule := `rule test {\n    meta: \n     author = \"Aviad Levy\"\n    strings:\n     $str = \"abc\"\n    condition:\n     $str\n   }`\n if err = c.AddString(rule, \"\"); err != nil {\n  fmt.Println(\"Error adding YARA rule:\", err)\n  return\n }\n r, err := c.GetRules()\n if err != nil {\n  fmt.Println(\"Error getting YARA rule:\", err)\n  return\n }\n var m yara.MatchRules\n err = r.ScanMem([]byte(\" abc \"), 0, 0, &#x26;m)\n if err != nil {\n  fmt.Println(\"Error matching YARA rule:\", err)\n  return\n }\n fmt.Printf(\"Matches: %+v\", m)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save this code to a file (e.g., main.go). Then, run the program using the go run command:</p>\n<pre><code>go run -ldflags \"-extldflags=-static\" -tags yara_static main.go\n</code></pre>\n<p>If everything is set up correctly, you should see the matched YARA rule printed on the screen.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed the go-yara library on your Windows machine and verified its functionality with a simple YARA rule scanning example. With this library, you can now take advantage of YARA’s powerful pattern matching capabilities in your Go projects.</p>\n<p>For more information and detailed documentation on go-yara, be sure to check out the official GitHub repository:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hillu/go-yara\"><strong>GitHub - hillu/go-yara: Go bindings for YARA</strong>\n*Go bindings for YARA.
